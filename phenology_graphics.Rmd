# Introduction
In 2023, Casco Bay Estuary Partnership (CBEP) funded a seasonal survey of the
timing of flowering and seed set of eelgrass (*Zostera marina*) in Casco Bay.
Scientists call the seasonal timing of flowering and other life history events 
"phenology". So this study is a study of eelgrass phenology in Casco Bay, Maine. 

The field project was conducted by "Team Zostera", a growing coalition of people
interested in eelgrass in the region led by Glenn Page, of SustainaMetrix.

Field observations were conducted at two eelgrass beds near Portland, Maine, one
near East End Beach, in Portland, and off the north end of Mackworth Island, in
Falmouth.  The two sites are about 1.75 miles apart as the crow flies.

Team Zostera provided CBEP with a copy of the field data in early September of
2023. In this workbook, we  assemble a "tidy" data frame based on their data and
explore options for graphic presentation of the study's results.

We anticipate little need for heavy-handed statistical methods, as a graphical
summary will convey the essential seasonal information.  The nature of the data
also limits options for statistical modelling. Generalized linear models (on
ordered data) could be useful for statistical comparison or to  quantify
seasonal variability, but that is not essential for a preliminary study.

A companion notebook (phenology_graphics.Rmd) provides code for and commentary
about our experience importing data from Excel sheets based on the field data 
sheets.

## Explanation of Data
Data was collected following a protocol ("SOPs", or "Standard Operating 
Procedures") developed by Jillian Carr (of the Massachusetts Bays Program) and 
Phil Colarusso (Of EPA's Region 1 office, in Boston.)  A copy of the protocol
is available by request to the Casco Bay Estuary Partnership.

For each sampling event, a minimum of five eelgrass flowering shoots were
collected.  For each shoot, each side-branch (formally called a "rhipidium") was
examined, in order from the bottom of the plant (oldest) to the top of the
plant (youngest).

Each side branch is a compound inflorescence, composed of multiple smaller
branchlets. On each side branch (formally, a "spathe"), the flowering stage of
each flowering branchlet was recorded. Order of branchlets (spathes) on the inflorescence (rhipidium) was not recorded.

Flowering stage was recorded as an ordered integer, with values from zero
(spathes developed, but styles not yet appeared) to six (seeds released, shoot
beginning to wither.)

## Data Properties
The sampling protocol generates data with complex structure, including both 
nesting and order information that may be important.

### Nesting
The nesting structure of the data includes the following:

* Spathe, nested within 

* Rhodium, ordered within 

* Shoot, nested within 

* Date, nested within

* Site

Site and Date are not crossed, as only one site was sampled on most sampling
days.

While we conducted no formal modeling in this initial analysis, it is worth
reflecting on the structure of the data, and how we might treat the data in
a hierarchical modelling framework.

Site and Date are naturally explanatory variables, best modeled as fixed
effects.  Shoots, on the other hand, are representative of all possible shoots
within each site, so Shoots are best modeled as random effects. Since the order
of the rhipidia on each shoot is meaningful, we need to model them somehow as
fixed effects, but it is not immediately clear how. Since shoots may vary in
age or number of rhipidia, order is not likely comparable across shoots, so
order should be modeled within shoots.

Wow. That data structure will generate complicated models for such a simple
observational study!

# Read Data
See the companion workbook for details on data import process.  Here we just 
import the previously prepared data that we saved in a ".csv' file format for 
convenient access.

```{r}
subfolder <- 'Working Data'
fn <- "phenology_data_2023.csv"
path <- file.path(subfolder, fn)
the_data <- read_delim(path)
```

# Prelimnary Graphics

## Stage Graphics
### Mean Stage of Inflorescences
```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
the_data %>%
  group_by(location, the_date, Shoot, Rhipidium) %>%
  summarize(mean_stage = mean(Spathe_num, na.rm = TRUE),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(the_date, mean_stage, color = location)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  #geom_smooth(method = "gam", formula = y~s(x, k = 3)) +
  labs(y = "Mean Stage of Spathes\nPer Inflorescense") +
  xlab("Date (2023)") +
  labs(color = "Location") +
  scale_colour_viridis_d()
```

```{r}
ggsave('Figures/mean_stage.png',
         width = 5, height = 3)
```

It is not at all surprising to see the mean stage of the spathes observed
climbing over the course of the season.

### Bar Charts of Stage
```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
the_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = the_date, fill = Spathe_num, group = -Spathe_num)) +
  geom_bar() +
  #facet_wrap(~location) +
  ylab("Number of Spathes") +
  xlab("Date (2023)") +
  labs(fill = "Stage") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c()
```

```{r}
ggsave('Figures/stage_bar.png',
         width = 5, height = 3)
```


```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
the_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = the_date, fill = Spathe_num, group = -Spathe_num)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  #facet_wrap(~location) +
  ylab("Percent of Spathes") +
  xlab("Date (2023)") +
  labs(fill = "Stage") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c()
```

```{r}
ggsave('Figures/stage_bar_percent.png',
         width = 5, height = 3)
```

We start to see substantial numbers and a significant percentage of spathes in 
Stages four or five beginning in late June or July.  Both percentage and numbers
appear to increase as the season progresses.  It would be interesting to extend
the sampling season next year to gain understanding of the end of the season as 
well.

## Frequency of Mature Spathes
We defined spathes in stages four or five as "mature" spathes.  The idea is those
spathes are mature enough to potentially provide seeds when harvested.

### Total Number of Mature Spathes
```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
the_data %>%
  mutate(is_four_five = Spathe_num == 5 | Spathe_num == 4) %>%
  group_by(location, the_date) %>%
  summarize(num_four_five = sum(is_four_five, na.rm = TRUE),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(x = the_date, y = num_four_five, color = location)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  #facet_wrap(~location) +
  ylab("Total Mature Spathes") +
  xlab("Date (2023)") +
  labs(color = "Location") +
  scale_colour_viridis_d()
```

```{r}
ggsave('Figures/spathes_in_45.png',
         width = 5, height = 3)
```

From a practical perspective, the total number of spathes that are at a stage 
where they might be harvested to collect seed is likely to be important for
efficiency of harvest. It does not look like we sampled late enough in the 
season in 2023 to document a drop-off in availability of suitable spathes.

### Overall Percent of Mature Spathes
This is an alternative graphic making more or less the same points. 

```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
the_data %>%
  filter( ! is.na(Spathe_num)) %>%
  mutate(is_four_five = Spathe_num == 5 | Spathe_num == 4) %>%
  group_by(location, the_date) %>%
  summarize(pct_four_five = sum(is_four_five)/length(is_four_five),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(x = the_date, y = pct_four_five, color = location)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  #facet_wrap(~location) +
  ylab("Percent Mature Spathes") +
  xlab("Date (2023)") +
  labs(color = "Location") +
  scale_colour_viridis_d()
```

```{r}
ggsave('Figures/overall_percent_stage_45.png',
         width = 5, height = 3)
```

### Shoot by Shoot Percent of Mature Spathes
Here the points have been moved around slightly and made partially transparent
to make it clear there's a lot of shoots in June with no mature spathes.
```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
  the_data %>%
  mutate(is_four_five = Spathe_num == 5 | Spathe_num == 4) %>%
  group_by(location, the_date, Shoot) %>%
  summarize(pct_45 = sum(is_four_five, na.rm = TRUE)/
                     (length(is_four_five) - sum(is.na(is_four_five))),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(the_date, pct_45, color = location)) +
  #geom_point(size = 2.5, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_jitter(size = 2.5, alpha = 0.65) +
  
  #geom_smooth(method = 'gam', formula = y~s(x, k = 3)) +
  ylab("Percent of Spathes") +
  xlab("Date (2023)") +
  labs(color = "Location") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  scale_color_viridis_d()
```
```{r}
ggsave('Figures/Shoot_percent_stage_45.png',
         width = 5, height = 3)
```

This offers a bit more understanding of variability among shoots. By mid-July, 
most shoots have at least 50% mature spathes, suggesting that's likely to be a 
good time to harvest. But the proportion of spathes that are mature varies
quite a bit.

As before, the data does not extend late enough in the season to show a drop off
in the number of mature spathes.

## Number of Infloresceneces and Spathes Per Shoot
### Number of Spathes per Inflorescence
If there are strong seasonal patterns in the number of spathes per
inflorescence, or the number of inflorescence per shoot, that might also
influence the ideal time for harvesting seed.  It is going to be best to sample
when we can get the most mature spathes, not the highest percentage of mature
spathes.

```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
the_data %>%
  group_by(location, the_date, Shoot, Rhipidium) %>%
  summarize(num_spathes = n(), 
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  ggplot(aes(the_date, num_spathes, color = location)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_smooth(method = "gam", formula = y~s(x, k = 3)) +
  ylab("Number of Spathes\nPer Inflorescence") +
  xlab("Date (2023)") +
  labs(color = "Location") +
  scale_colour_viridis_d()
```

```{r}
ggsave('Figures/spathes_per_inf.png',
         width = 5, height = 3)
```

### Number of Inflorescences Per Shoot
```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
the_data %>%
  group_by(location, the_date, Shoot, Rhipidium) %>%
  summarize(.groups = 'drop_last') %>%
  summarize(num_Rhipidia = n(), 
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  ggplot(aes(the_date, num_Rhipidia, color = location)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_smooth(method = "gam", formula = y~s(x, k = 3)) +
  ylab("Number of \nInflorescenses\nPer Shoot") +
  xlab("Date (2023)") +
  labs(color = "Location") +
  scale_colour_viridis_d()
```

```{r}
ggsave('Figures/infl_per_shoot.png',
         width = 5, height = 3)
```

The number of spathes per inflorescence continued to increase through the 
summer, while the number of inflorescences per shoot appears to peak sometime in 
late June or early July.  Given the limited data, those apparent patterns may 
reflect sampling variability (note the wide error bands). This deserves 
additional attention in future years.

# Future Questions / Directions to Consider

1.  Differences in Stage by order of Inflorescence on the Shoot.

2.  Hierarchical Generalized Linear Models of Stage, based on ordered data.
